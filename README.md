# Sudoku
- A Sudoku game created using Java.
- The Sudoku board is created from a 2D array and the board is generated by populating the cells (row, column, and 3x3 grid) while ensuring that no integers are being repeated in its respectful row, column or 3x3 grid.
- While the board is being populated, it skips certain parts of the board to leave them empty for the user to solve.
# Methods
- The general methods used in this project is a validition method to check and validate that each input is valid and it belongs in its spot. The method will search the row, cell and 3x3 grid for any repetition, if it passes, it moves to the next step, else it will ask for another try from the user
- Another method is to check if the sudoku board has been solved (finished in this case since there will only be one solution per sudoku board)
